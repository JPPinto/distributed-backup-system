/**
 *Header
 *
 *        The header consists of a sequence of ASCII lines, sequences of ASCII codes terminated with the sequence '0x0D' '0x0A',
 * which we denote <CRLF> because these are the ASCII codes of the CR and LF chars respectively. Each line is a sequence of
 * fields, sequences of ASCII codes separated by spaces, the ASCII char ' '. The header always terminates with an empty header line.
 *
 *        In the version described herein, the header has only the following non-empty single line:
 *<MessageType> <Version> <FileId> <ChunkNo> <ReplicationDeg> <CRLF>
 *
 *Some of these fields may not be used by some messages, but all fields that appear in a message must appear in the
 * relative order specified above.
 *
 *        Next we describe the meaning of each field and its format.
 *
 *<MessageType>
 *This is the type of the message. Each sub protocol specifies its own message types. This field determines the format of
 * the message and what actions its receivers should perform. This is encoded as a variable length sequence of ASCII characters.
 *
 *<Version>
 *This is the version of the protocol. It is a three ASCII char sequence with the format <n>'.'<m>, where <n> and <m> are
 * the ASCII codes of digits. For example, version 1.0, the one specified in this document, should be encoded as the char sequence '1''.''0'.
 *
 *<FileId>
 *This is the file identifier for the backup service. As stated above, it is supposed to be obtained by using the SHA256
 * cryptographic hash function. As its name indicates its length is 256 bit, i.e. 32 bytes, and should be encoded as a 64
 * ASCII character sequence. The encoding is as follows: each byte of the hash value is encoded by the two ASCII characters
 * corresponding to the hexadecimal representation of that byte. E.g., a byte with value 0xB2 should be represented by the
 * two char sequence 'B''2' (or 'b''2', it does not matter). The entire hash is represented in big-endian order, i.e. from
 * the MSB (byte 31) to the LSB (byte 0).
 *
 *<ChunkNo>
 *This field together with the FileId specifies a chunk in the file. The chunk numbers are integers and should be assigned
 * sequentially starting at 0. It is encoded as a sequence of ASCII characters corresponding to the decimal representation
 * of that number, with the most significant digit first. The length of this field is variable, but should not be larger
 * than 6 chars. Therefore, each file can have at most one million chunks. Given that each chunk is 64 KByte, this limits
 * the size of the files to backup to 64 GByte.
 *
 * <ReplicationDeg>
 * This field contains the desired replication degree of the chunk. This is a digit, thus allowing a replication degree of
 *  up to 9. It takes one byte, which is the ASCII code of that digit.
